        <h1>How Uber works</h1>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-30">
            <p>
              On-demand transportation technology is our core service, and the
              app that connects driver-partners and riders is what makes it all
              possible. Here’s how it works, step by step:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-50">
            <div class="paragraph">
              <h4 style="margin-top: 0">Step 1: A rider opens the app</h4>
              <p>
                The rider enters their destination into the Where to? box on the
                top of the screen; taps each ride option to see the wait time,
                car sizes, and price; then confirms their pickup location and
                taps Request.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <h4>Step 2: The rider is matched with a driver</h4>
              <p>
                A nearby driver sees and chooses to accept the rider’s trip
                request. The rider is automatically notified when the driver’s
                vehicle is about a minute away.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <h4>Step 3: The driver picks up the rider</h4>
              <p>
                The driver and the rider verify each other’s names and the
                destination. Then the driver starts the ride.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <h4>Step 4: The driver takes the rider to the destination</h4>
              <p>
                The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn
                directions, so the driver can focus on getting there and the
                rider can focus on enjoying a comfortable ride.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <h4>
                The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn
                directions, so the driver can focus on getting there and the
                rider can focus on enjoying a comfortable ride.
              </h4>
              <p>
                At the end of each trip, drivers and riders can rate each other
                from 1 to 5 stars. Riders can also give the driver compliments.
                In cities where tipping is available, they can also add a little
                extra to show their gratitude.
